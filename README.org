#+TITLE: Nolan's Forth for Linux on ARM processors.

Using only a shell (and Emacs ğŸ¤«), statically and dynamically linked ELF files are
built that can load an assembler and cross compiler to rebuild
themselves.

* Dependencies
** Runtime
- One of:
  - Termux on Android
  - GNU/Linux
- Thumb capable ARM, with Thumb 2 preferred
** Build
- Bash
- Make
- Git

* Quick Start

Building with the shell script is quite slow.
The prebuilt binaries under ~./bootstrap/~ can be used to skip steps.

~./bootstrap/interp.static.elf~ only requires a Linux kernel, but can not load dynamic libraries.
~./bootstrap/interp.android.elf~ is built to use Android's dynamic linker.
~./bootstrap/interp.gnueabi.elf~ is built to use the GNU dynamic linker found on desktops.

Termux may set ~$LD_PRELOAD~ which requires unsetting it: ~LD_PRELOAD='' ./bin/interp.elf~

* Building

~make~ is the preferred build tool.

The default task, ~make all~, will use Bash to boot strap a static executable: ~bin/interp.elf~.
This will then be used to rebuild itself as ~bin/interp.${linker}.1.elf~ and ~bin/builder.${linker}.1.elf~ which then builds a dynamically linked versions with the  ~2.elf~ suffix.
~${linker}~ may be any or all of ~static~, ~android~, and ~gnueabi~.
The ~OUT_TARGETS~ Make variable controls this.
Be prepared to wait.

The build script ~src/bin/${app}.4th~ can be built by running ~make bin/${app}.elf~.
This build will be done with Bash. ~make bin/${app}.1.elf~ will use ~bin/interp.1.elf~.
The ~1~ can be changed to any value with 1, 2, and 3 typically used.

~make boot~ will rebuild ~./bootstrap/~ from a clean clone of the repository.

* Running

All executables built can be found in ~./bin/~.

** Bash

~./src/bash/forth.sh~ is Forth writen for Bash.
It is used before any binary is available.

~load-core~ will load the compiling words.
This load step can be skipped by using ~./bin/fforth~ after running ~make bin/fforth.dict~.

Build scripts under ~src/bin/~ can be ~cat~ into it and writen to a file:
~cat src/bin/interp.4th | ./src/bash/forth.sh > interp.elf~

** Boot strapped

A list of words can be printed with ~words~. Compiling words with ~iwords~.

*** Loaders

Once running, various sets of functionality can be loaded with the following words:

**** load-core
Very essential functions mostly found in ~./src/interp/boot/core.4th~.

**** load-debug
Collection of value printers found in ~./src/interp/boot/debug/~.

**** load-thumb-asm
Words to assemble Thumb code and cross compile.

**** load-runner
Starts the self build of the ops needed for an interpreter.

**** load-interp
Loads the bare interpreter when building.
