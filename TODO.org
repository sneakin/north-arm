#+TITLE: North: Bash Bootstrap

* Goals
** Ultimate:
ELF file that only has an offset thread into a dynamically linked symbol table and interpreter.
** DONE Primary:
Build an ELF file that can execute the code to build itself.
** Secondary:
North Runner compatible with the x86 runner that can mmap a file to execute.
** Get out of the Turing Tar Pit.
* Tasks
** September!
*** No way to call foreign function pointers without making a word.
*** Move boot/cross.4th int src/cross?
*** Output cell-size: Use ~out-cell-size~ in cross compiling and other ouput words. ~out-op-size~ could replace ~-op-size~ too.
**** Use ~,cell~ instead of ~,uint32~ to make cross words more portable. ~,out-cell~?
*** Have a (super) lite version of the runner and interpreter. Only cell sized math. Minimal syscalls. No debugging aids. Barely able to load-core.
*** Thumb and x86 assemblers need to built into the builder.
    Placing each in separate dictionaries could work. defop/endop could load/unload could work for all but macros. Builder adds those words?
** August
*** big integers
**** int64 file organization
**** parse-int for int64
**** int64 literal words
*** defining immediates in binary
    Three sets of immediates:
      * interpreter: top level, interpretable, used in evaluated defs
      * cross compiling: interpretable, only used when [cross] compiling
      * output: compiled into binary, listed in binary's immediates.
    
*** structs in binary
    Defines constants and immediates needed during compilation, and generates accessors needed in compiled output.
*** More dictionary meta data: files loaded, definition source location
*** process.4th
**** function to start with a provided function
**** execve wrapper to run system commands: needs to builh/copy env and an argv array of strings
** July
*** self contained binaries
**** boot/core and friends
***** immediates
***** better dictionary separation by switching modes & dictionaries
**** clock, raycaster
**** eliminate aliases
**** DONE standalone builder w/ files on command line
*** actual compilation to machine code
**** DONE sized sequences for code fields
**** copy code field, may need a trampoline field or every interpreted word needs a copied code sequence
*** Dictionaries
**** Remove dedicated register
**** Association list
**** Ops with doop code, assembly data fields?
**** Reorder ~dict-map~ arguments to make ~fn~ last.
**** Delay writing out until the end of building?
*** error handler, catch and throw
** <=June?
*** struct fields don't resolve right w/ b and b1 fields.
*** swap tty-cursor-to's arguments to row, column
*** cross-lookup in bash takes one argument, interp's version takes two.
*** DONE cpio file format as arguments
*** float tests
*** uint64
**** TODO byte order differs from stack / argument and poked memory order
     Little endian puts LSB at the lower address. Stack ordering has LSB at the higher address.
     But byte order in code needs to be consistent on big and little endian systems, which may need 64 bit support in the integer reader instead of faking it.
*** core.4th needs a split to allow inclusion in binary
** Sooner than later
*** current-tty and standard-tty that opens /dev/tty for IO
**** needs writes that take an fd
**** reads need fd too
*** Crashes with ~literal int32 123~
*** s" places the string onto the data stack polluting the binary. Special interp version for defproper?
*** DONE [#A] structures
*** TODO [#A] variables with data on stack or data segment. initialized on load
*** [#B] ELF exports
*** TODO [#A] Build improvement
**** Multiple targets: thumb 1 & 2, a32, a64, x86, bacaw; android, linux, baremetal; static, dynamic
**** Dependencies: only execute/scan for load
*** Local variables
*** North porting
*** [#B] Error handler
*** [#C] Zero copy reading
Would only work when the token does not span reads.
*** Compiling to assembly
*** egl & TTY drawing
*** bare metal
**** Pi Zero / 2
**** Pi 3
**** M0 / micro:bit
*** Ports
**** x86
**** bacaw
*** quine
The ability to dump the program to source code into a loadable and buildable format.
**** Disasm
***** integrated into dictionary dump
***** DONE Sized sequences for code fields
**** immediates
**** hexadecimal prefixes
**** DONE cstring needs to not appear before string literals
*** [#A] builder binary
**** Needs immediate dictionary writing and overrides.
**** Command line arguments
** Standard Forth
*** Comma & period words
Standard Forth uses these for stream output.
Switching to < or > like standard stack ops.
**** byte data
,ins breaks the rule on ~,word~ and ~.word~.
**** asm ops
*** DONE CASE

*** locals
{ arg1 arg0 | local0 -- result }
** String readers have length limit of token-buffer-max. Could/should read more.
** Full cpio archive concatenated onto binary.
*** needs memory decoding instead of file reads
*** And/or cpio header file offset argument
*** cpio encoder
*** compressed?
** Postpone lookup with and without immediates
** Using ~'~ in a definition should be like ~literal~
#BEGIN_SRC
: ' hello literal hey assert-equals
#END_SRC
** Makefile cross compile support
*** Makefile needs TARGET and HOST documented
*** Makefile detection for HOST defaulted to aarch64 forcing use of qemu.
*** Runner needs targeting
** For op specific data: if the word is in R1, can that be used to address the data field for...? perhaps not for init.

#+END
** Building
Need to better handle targets and loading their sources. Too much duplication.
Pass sources in as args from Makefile? Every file requires what it needs?
*** Loading the assembler words into a Bash generated binary vs. catting them in and dumping?
**** Words needed for catting:
Cat in the better compiler.
Cat in just the assembler.

***** Top level
const> var>
load

***** Functions
Creating dictionary entries: make-dict-entry create
dict-entry accessors
compiling-read with immediates: reuse
comments & strings
string appending

Dictionary entries that are and have real pointers.
All their fields need CS added.
Threads too: offset & indirect.
Data stack: relative or absolute?

*** DONE argc/argv
**** DONE getopt like function
** DONE Separate ops and definitions
** TODO Separate bash specific defs from the general
** DONE Variables
*** DONE Move to own segment
** DONE Flip int-sub args in runner
** Use just 'end' instead of 'end.*'?

** Reader return: drop for negative lengths on reads subsequent to failure
** DONE compiling-read with empty defs, defcol with single element
concat-seq down-stack uses
revmap-stack? stack-find?

** Tail call optimizations
*** Proper colon defs
*** Framed calls
** TODO Reader needs its own token buffer; no need to return last char/status, negative happens next read
** TODO create> should return the entry, does-col should use it
Bash specifically.
** DONE load: reader needs data slot and finalizer, and a stack of readers
** TODO stage1
*** DONE Hexadecimal numbers for input
*** DONE Load or cat?
load needs file opening and reading with a reader stack.
*** DONE definitions writen to the data stack
*** definitions with code reuse

*** import for use in current module
*** brings in name spacing: what word lists to search when compiling
*** in-package & export/public & import interplays
** Lambda / Code blocks & lists: use [ ] to delineate
** DONE To cross compile: need const>, var>, get-word, set-word, IF/ELSE/THEN

*** lib
*** stage1: thumb forth
**** interpreter

** code fields need to point at words, not code
** Tension between output offsets and pointers; dhere is an offset or translate when needed?
** null (last dictionary) lets lookup return a null, default object.
** DONE string readers
" returns a pointer & length when bash cross compiles.
" returns just a pointer in interp
Maintaining the length some where is good.
s" c" tmp" d" ; some only make sense when interpreting at top level
Touches words that take pointer or a pointer/length pair.
*** Currently
| fn   | TL storage | def storage | returns               |
| c"   | stack      |             | chars length          |
| d"   | data       | data        | pointer length        |
| s"   | stack      | data        | pointer length        |
| tmp" | buffer     |             | pointer length        |
| "    | ??         | ??          | bash: pointer         |
|      |            |             | cross: pointer length |
|      |            |             | interp: pointer!      |
*** Desired
| fn   | TL storage | def storage | returns               |

*** TODO builder executable that's passed files to build
**** immediate list built for executable
**** DONE flags to toggle static/dynamic, linux/android, elf32/64
*** sigill trap to detect cpu ops
** TODO x86
** Interpreted IF & UNLESS in Bash could not be postponed
** DONE Called ops & LR
Calling ops like any other procedure makes subroutine call threading easy.
*** LR only needs to be pushed if an op makes a call.
**** Returns are popping into PC
**** For an op without calls just a mov PC, LR.
*** Ops can get back to next if next sets LR.
*** When does next exit??
Needs an explicit BYE. exit gets out of a thread, restoring eip.
*** TODO Where LR should be restored?
**** Only save LR with an outer-exec? Exit by clearing stack and setting PC. Or exit up all the way.
**** Mixing threading types? Puts responsibility on enter and exit to return to the right procedure caller.
***** Requires defcol to factor in a multiple valued return record. swap-call-frame
EIP, LR
*** Assembling Call threading
**** Ops & Compiled definitions
branch-link
possible jump table
**** Interpreted words
Inline exec
**** Should be the same so runtime changes can happen.

** Numbers
*** Prefixed hexadecimal output: 0xNN
*** DONE Arbitrary base output
*** Floating point input
*** Floating point output
**** overflows integers and fraction needs zero padding
**** exponent: NNeXX
*** Floating point constants: pi, e, +/- infinity, nan, +/- 0
**** DONE 32 bit
**** 64 bit
** Math
*** log2, logn
**** DONE integers
***** optimize by splitting
**** floats
*** exp, pow, sqrt
**** integers
**** floats
**** optimize
     exp has a trick reusing results
*** trigonometry: sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan
**** circular
**** hyperbolic
**** float64
*** big integers
**** arithmetic
**** logic
**** comparisons
**** writers
**** conversions

* Thoughts
** def syntax
*** Current
var>
const>
alias>
defcol => defcolon
def
:

*** General def and lists
Scheme style symbol table

**** Dictionary
***** dict is an assoc list
***** values are function objects
Head points to a Type that has a caller attribute.
Tail points to the definition sequence.

**** Sequences
[ exprs... ] => sequence
'[ exprs... ] => sequence of resolved, but unexecuted, symbols

**** Variables
def name value
def name s[ exprs... ]
**** Colon definitions
def name [ exprs... ]
def name colon[ exprs... ]
**** Framed colon definitions
def name fun[ exprs... ]
def name begin[ exprs... ]
def name fun( args... ) exprs... end

def name fun exprs... end
def name begin exprs... end
def name fun( args... )[ exprs... ]

def name [ args... ] do exprs... end
def name [ args... ] { exprs... }
*** Cross compiling reads
Need to restore state. Globals make this tough, but compiler object with output stack, immediates, and words can handle that.
** Optimizations
*** Constants can be immediates
*** Inlining
*** To assembly call threading
*** repeated call sequences that have no side effects and return the same values each call can set a generated binding.
*** Arithmetic between constants
*** Division and multiply by powers of two
*** Tail calls
*** function that can call defs and ops w/o pushing return address or creating frames, name it exec?
** dict register -> this pointer
Calls in a definition are indexed from the register.
Dictionary specified at compile time by specifying a type.
** Next words
*** Current
func> tokens+
func: tokens+
*** Possible
Difference in the interpretation of what gets read and returned.

**** Compiling state with lookup and immediates.
func[ tokens... ]
func [ tokens... ]

Reads in a colon definition.

**** less than compiling. With immediates?
func< (types|atoms)+ >
func < (types|atoms)+ >

Needed for creating generic types via generator functions.
Interpretation semantics: at minimum, words looked up, value placed on stack.
'>' completes the read with word values on stack.

**** Other syntaxes
***** Lists
func( tokens+ )
func{ tokens+ }

Immediates?

***** Strings
func" chars*"
